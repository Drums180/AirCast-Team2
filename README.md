## Introduction

Welcome to our web application, the Flight and Weather Planner! Our goal is to simplify the process of travel planning by providing all the necessary information in one convenient location. With our application, you'll be able to search for the best deals on flights and view real-time weather updates for your destination all in one place. Say goodbye to the hassle of searching multiple websites, and hello to a more efficient and enjoyable travel planning experience. 💻🛫🌦️

This means that you no longer have to waste time searching multiple websites, and can plan your trip with ease. To make it even easier, our application only displays the top 3 flight options, making it simple for you to compare and choose the best flight for you. With our user-friendly interface, you can quickly and easily find the information you need to plan your next trip.🛫🌦️🗺️
